Floor

		floor should have a % chance of additional room generation
		apply chance to all open slots of all rooms (and apply to rooms created this way)
Enemies should have target range to be in for attacking, instead of fixed boundary (to allow for backing away for ranged attacks)
Black, semi-transparent texture over non-completed rooms to simulate shadows and light source

	when room is cleared, all shadows removed

	If invulnerable when starting to block, end of invulnerability turns off block effect
	Barrels collision doesn't go away as soon as it should
