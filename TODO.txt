	can buy hearts, shields, relics
	can remove card(s) from deck
	card container doesn't exist while in the shop

Floor
	Block neighbors of Start and Boss rooms other than single path.
	add rooms randomly to other rooms
		floor should have a % chance of additional room generation
		apply chance to all open slots of all rooms (and apply to rooms created this way)

Enemies should have target range to be in for attacking, instead of fixed boundary (to allow for backing away for ranged attacks)
Black, semi-transparent texture over non-completed rooms to simulate shadows and light source
	Player is lit, reducing shadow
	wall fixtures are lit, reducing shadow
	when room is cleared, all shadows removed
Player Sprites
	Walking animation, 3 angles
	Idle animation
Deck Shuffle Animation
	all cards in deck get a slight move away from deck position, and an appropriate angle
	in a short time, tween back in to angle 0 and at deck position

BUGS
	Drawing critical path from start room to boss room can draw itself in and break 
	If invulnerable when starting to block, end of invulnerability turns off block effect
