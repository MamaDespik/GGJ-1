Action deck builder 
	You have a hand off three cards that control all your actions (attack, dash, heal, block, etc.). 
	Used cards go to discard, immediately replaced by the next card on your deck.
	Combo cards can replace themselves with the next card on the combo on use (eg triple attack). 
	Rougelike akin to Isaac.
